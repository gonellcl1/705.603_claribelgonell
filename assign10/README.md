## About Assignment 10

The assignment explores AWS Sagemaker to build, train, and deploy reinforcement learning models. A local and AWS implementation of Blackjack RL (https://trevormcguire.medium.com/blackjack-stocks-and-reinforcement-learning-ea4014115aeb) are deployed. The local RL code is adapted to use AWS's virtual machine for training and developing an exposed web service.
