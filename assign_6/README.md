Module 6 - Assignment 6


<!-- ABOUT THE ASSIGNMENT -->
## About Assignment 6

The Assignment uses MongoDB (a NoSQL document database) and Neo4J (a NoSQL graphical database) to store speed dating data. The data is then prepared to create a supervised machine learning model that predicts a match. The following models were used: Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machine, and Gaussian Naive Bayes.
SVM produced the highest vaildation metric accuracy. 

Contrasting MongoDB vs. Neo4J

Neo4J

Advantages: schema optional, navigation through tree traversal(very true to graph structure)

Disadvantages: no partioning methods

Best Suitable For: Graph database management systems; data that requires entity-relationship integrity

MongoDB

Advantages: document store structure makes it very easy to query and is schema-less, very flexible

Disadvantages: cannot create relationships

Best Suitable For: Everything else.
